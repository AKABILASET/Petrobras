The provided input shows only a modified file named 'Estudar' which appears to be a regular file without any clear extension indicating it's a build artifact, dependency, or temporary file. Since there are no compiled files, dependency directories, editor files, or other typical artifacts to ignore, and the change list doesn't contain any of the usual suspects for gitignore rules, no additional rules are needed.

The original .gitignore content is empty, and since the modified file 'Estudar' doesn't match any common ignore patterns, the result should remain empty.
